# Project: Create an online dashboard with dash and python

This project is the continuation of [this project](./ETL_Pipeline) where we extracted information of different
restaurants form yelp, using its API.

The result is a beautiful dashboard full interactive and informative. The core components used for this dashboard are:

- A Table that shows information about each restaurant
- A Pie chart that compares the amount of reviews for each restaurant
- A Bar chart which depicts the ratings for each restaurant

Finally, a filter is used fot the user to select each type of restaurant is needed.

## How to run the code

The dashboard is not published in any public domain, so it needs to be activated locally.

```cmd
> python app.py
```

with this command a local version of the dashboard will be executed.
