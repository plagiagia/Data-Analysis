In these files, you will find all the SQL code which solves specific tasks for our project.

We start by building the Database and after the tables. We load the RAW data and split them into logical groups.

After we run some queries to answer questions using the data.

In each task-folder there is a README file, explaining the task and a Diagram of the tables that are used to make the queries.
