This is a repository with all my projects, showcasing my skills in data engineering and data analysis.

## Project: *Convert company excel sheets to Relational DB*

## Project: *ETL and Visualizing Airbnb dataset*
We have a dataset of Airbnb users in an excel sheet and we want to understand it and make a dashboard of all the important features.

This project is a combination of building an ETL pipeline and also analyzing the final data.
For the ETL process I used the `Microsoft Visual Studio` and for the Visualizations the `Microsoft Power BI`

 - Create the database
  - Make the Data flow with all the transformations
  - Load the data into the database
  - Make the analysis
  - Create the final Dashboard

## Project: *API  to SQL pipeline*
This project is about a data Pipeline that takes data from an API and puts them into a SQL database. I used the [Yelp](https://www.yelp.de/berlin) API to search about restaurants in Berlin.

 -  Make the request
  - Transform the Data to fit into a pandas data frame
  - Load the data into the database
  - Run some queries to find interesting information
