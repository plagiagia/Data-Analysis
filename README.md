# Data Analysis portfolio
This is a repository with all my projects, showcasing my skills in data engineering and data analysis. The inspirations of the projects came while being either on Mentorship or in a Self-taught environment from online sources such as [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/),  [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), [DataQuest](https://www.dataquest.io/) and others.

## Project: *ETL and Visualizing Airbnb dataset*
We have a dataset of Airbnb users in an excel sheet and we want to understand it and make a dashboard of all the important features.

This project is a combination of building an ETL pipeline and also analyzing the final data.
For the ETL process I used the `Microsoft Visual Studio` and for the Visualizations the `Microsoft Power BI`

 - Create the database
  - Make the Data flow with all the transformations
  - Load the data into the database
  - Make the analysis
  - Create the final Dashboard
